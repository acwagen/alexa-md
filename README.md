# Alexa MD

## Getting Started

Follow the [steps to create an Alexa skill](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/devconsole/create-a-skill-and-choose-the-interaction-model.html#create-a-new-skill) and give the skill the name and invocation name 'file system.'

Select 'JSON Editor', copy the intents.json file and paste it into the editor.
Build the model.

Running the skill locally is optional. To run with the deployed app, follow the instructions below to set the skill's endpoint, and enter https://e73a546c.ngrok.io/ for the url.

Navigate to the 'Endpoint' section of the Alexa Developer Console of the File System skill. Select the HTTPS button and paste the https ngrok url into the 'Default Region' field. Select 'My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority', save the endpoint, and navigate to the Test tab. Start the skill with the invocation name, 'file system.'
